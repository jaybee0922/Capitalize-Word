Challenge 3
Instructions:

Create a new array called capitalizedWords with the words from the words array with the first letter of each word capitalized.

Expected Result:

const words = ['coder', 'programmer', 'developer'];

console.log(capitalizedWords); // ['Coder', 'Programmer', 'Developer']
Hint:

Remember back our previous lectures, we had a challenge to capitalize the first letter of a string. You are doing the same thing here, but for each word in the array.
